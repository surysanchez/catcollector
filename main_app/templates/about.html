<h3>Here are some fun facts about them:</h3>

<h5 style="color: coral">Cats don’t only purr when they are happy.</h5>

  Every cat owner loves to hear their pet purring beside them, like a contented
  little Roomba. But the idea that cats purr because they’re happy or satisfied
  may not be entirely accurate. Yes, they purr when they’re being petted or
  nursing their kittens, but they also purr in stressful situations—which has
  led to an ongoing debate about why they do it and what purpose it serves.
  Researchers have determined that cats purr at frequencies between 25 and 150
  Hertz, a frequency range that “can improve bone density and promote healing.”
  According to Leslie Lyons, an assistant professor at the School of Veterinary
  Medicine at the University of California, Davis, cats may purr as a way to
  stimulate their bones and muscles without expending any real energy or
  stressing their bodies. “Although it is tempting to state that cats purr
  because they are happy, it is more plausible that cat purring is a means of
  communication and a potential source of self-healing,” Lyons told Scientific
  American.

  I recently saw a kid in an airport who was wearing a T-shirt that said “Cats
  Rule, Dogs Drool,” which is more accurate than you think. Cats do rule, at
  least from an evolutionary perspective. A recent study of more than 2,000
  fossils showed that members of the cat family (felids) were better hunters and
  more capable of survival than their dog (canid) counterparts. The study,
  published in the journal PNAS, found that cats out-fought and out-hunted dogs,
  making the most of the available resources. That led to a significant decline
  in the number of wild dog species that survived. “The arrival of cats to North
  America had a deadly impact on the diversity of the dog family,” the report’s
  lead author, Dr. Daniele Silvestro, says.

  “Mr. Sniffles. Mr. Sniffles? MR. SNIFFLES!” You know your cat knows his name,
  your cat knows that he knows his name, and you both know that he’s ignoring
  you. Researchers know it, too, and have tested it by playing cats recordings
  of their names being spoken aloud by four strangers and their owners. Although
  cats displayed behavior indicating that they knew their names were being
  called, they still chose not to respond, even to their owners. The study,
  which was published in the journal Animal Cognition, suggested that this was
  because cats, unlike dogs, were not domesticated to listen to humans, or to
  try to please them. “Historically speaking, cats, unlike dogs, have not been
  domesticated to obey humans’ orders,” the authors wrote. “Rather, they seem to
  take the initiative in human-cat interaction.” LOOK AT ME, MR. SNIFFLES! LOOK
  AT ME.
